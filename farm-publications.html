            <p style="line-height: 1.8">
              Integrated crop-livestock farm (ICLF), also known as polyface or
              mixed crop-livestock farming (MCLF), is a traditional type of
              commercial agricultural practice associated with the production of
              both crops and animals on one farm. After decades of successful
              commercial scale farming performance, ICLF practices are growing
              rapidly in the US, especially in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast
              regions. A large number of ICLF farms are non-certified or in
              organic transition, and they contribute a significant amount of
              fresh produce and meat products - specifically lamb and goat meat
              - to the US organic food supply chain. Products from ICLFs are
              sold in either farmers markets, foadside stands, and/or local
              retail markets. The USDA promotes farmers markets across the
              country, and currently more than 8,000 farmers markets are now
              listed in the National Farmers Market Directory.

              <br /><br />

              Recent reports say that products grown from ICLFs are contaminated
              with several bacterial pathogens at significantly higher levels
              than conventionally grown produce. This may be in part due to the
              close proximity of animal and produce operations on the same farm,
              which could increase the potential for cross-contamination between
              animal reservoirs and fresh produce. The most common bacterial
              pathogens involved in reported outbreaks were sigatoxin producing
              Escheria coli (STEC) and Salmonella enterica (SE). Major
              reservoirs for both SE and STEC are farm animals including
              poultry, pig, goat, and cattle where they can survive in soil,
              water and plants and contaminate produce.
              <br /><br />
              Given the numbers of foodborne illnesses with these two pathogens,
              the economic impacts in the range of $1.6 billion and $190
              million, respectively.

              <p>
                Our study aims to evaluate the persistence of SE and STEC in the
                environment of ICLFs, or in host/reservoirs, and the process by
                which produce becomes contaminated. This project will also
                develop effective practices to control contamination of ICLF
                products by these pathogens at the pre-harvest stage and assess
                the role of natural antimicrobial to eliminate these emerging
                zoonotic agents from ICLF products at the post-harvest level.

              <p>
                From 2019 to 2021, the lab collected 3,000 samples from farms
                around Maryland and Virginia and consolidated our findings to
                provide recommendations for maintaining a safe farm.
