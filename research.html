            Control colonization of pathogenic Salmonella in poultry by
            autolytic intracellular Salmonella vaccine.
          </h2>
          <p>
            In the US, salmonellosis is the second most common foodborne
            disease. One of the major routes of human salmonellosis is believed
            to be consumption and handling of contaminated poultry and poultry
            products, as Salmonella colonizes the chicken gut as part of the
            normal flora. Thus, strategies for controlling the colonization of
            Salmonella in poultry gut, to reduce the incidence of salmonellosis
            in humans, are essential. We have developed a lysogenic Salmonella
            vaccine strain (ST +P13/19 ) by inserting genes 13 (holing) and 19
            (lysozyme) of bacteriophage P22 into downstream of sseA, the
            chaperone of SPI-2 genes of Salmonella enterica (SE) serovar
            Typhimutium (LT2). Thus the expression of both genes were controlled
            by the sseA promoter in intracellular conditions. We found that the
            intracellular viability of ST +P13/19 was reduced &gt;95% compared
            to LT2 in chicken macrophage cells, and significantly increased
            pro-inflammatory cytokines and endosomal toll-like receptors. In
            this project, we aim to evaluate the role of this non-pathogenic and
            autolytic ST +P13/19 vaccine strain in outcompeting pathogenic SE
            colonization and preventing cross-contamination of poultry products
            in a chick model. To achieve our goals, we propose these specific
            aims: 1) Evaluate the protection ability against colonization of
            various pathogenic SE serovars like Typhimurium and/or Enteritidis
            in Broiler chicks; and 2) Evaluate the host immunity and gut health
            during the intracellular lysis of the Salmonella vaccine strain in
            the chicken intestine. Outcomes of this project will improve the
            safety of the poultry products and reduce the human gastrointestinal
            infection with Salmonella and improve human health.

            Ecology, Transmission and Control of Salmonella and Shigatoxin
            Producing E. coli in Integrated Crop-Livestock Farms
          </h2>
          <p>
            Increasing demand for organic food often is not met due to the
            limited number of producers engaging/adopting the management
            complexities fundamental to organic system and required to meet
            production parity with conventional systems. Complexities involve
            soil fertility/nutrients, diverse soil biological communities, soil
            health, and use of cover crops and animal manures often on
            integrated crop-livestock farms (ICLF). Microbial ecology on ICLF
            also can impact food safety through pathogen transfer between
            animals and crops. Recent reports of pathogen contaminated products
            sold in local organic retail, roadside and farmers markets highlight
            the need for assessment of the ecological patterns of bacterial
            pathogens, when they occur on ICLFs, and their survival/transfer to
            crops through use of raw or composted manure- based soil amendments,
            or by workers, equipment, and vectors. We propose to assess the
            ecological patterns of two major bacterial pathogens, Salmonella
            enterica (SE) and shigatoxin- producing E. coli (STEC), including
            their survival/transmission pathways and develop control strategies.
            The project objectives are to a) Determine the sources, survival
            ability in the farm environment and contamination pathways of SE and
            STEC; b) Develop practical means to control SE and STEC farm
            environment and eliminate from produce by using alternative natural
            antimicrobial components; and c) Disseminate outcomes of the project
            for controlling contamination by on-farm practices and the best
            options to eliminate these pathogens from the produce to diverse
            stakeholders. The study will generate extensive data on the dynamics
            of these bacterial pathogens in ICLF and its products and offer
            effective control strategies.

            Salmonella enterica is one of the major bacterial pathogens
            responsible for the burden of foodborne illness in the USA. In
            addition to this, an increasing pattern of antibiotic resistance
            necessitates the development of novel antimicrobials. Plants remain
            a prime source for novel compounds with bioactive potential, many of
            which can be found in the form of phenolic acids. These have
            demonstrated antimicrobial potential against Salmonella enterica
            serovar Typhimurium, while also impairing specific virulence
            factors. Further research is being performed to elucidate the
            mechanisms of action underlying compound efficacy, and their effect
            on cellular functions of the bacteria, while also assessing their
            impact on other bacterial communities within the gut microbiome.

          A Highly Effective Bacteriophage-1252 to Control Multiple Serovars of

          Salmonella enterica (S. enterica) is the most common foodborne
          pathogen worldwide, leading to massive economic loss and a significant
          burden on the healthcare system. The primary source of S. enterica
          remains contaminated or undercooked poultry products. Considering the
          number of foodborne illnesses with multiple antibiotic resistant S.
          enterica, new controlling approaches are necessary. Bacteriophage
          (phage) therapies have emerged as a promising alternative to
          controlling bacterial pathogens. However, the limitation on the lysis
          ability of most phages is their species-specificity to the bacterium.
          S. enterica has various serovars, and several major serovars are
          involved in gastrointestinal diseases in the USA. In this study,
          Salmonella bacteriophage-1252 (phage-1252) was isolated and found to
          have the highest lytic activity against multiple serovars of S.
          enterica, including Typhimurium, Enteritidis, Newport, Heidelberg,
          Kentucky, and Gallinarum. Whole-genome sequencing analysis revealed
          phage-1252 is a novel phage strain that belongs to the genus
          Duplodnaviria in the Myoviridae family, and consists of a 244,421 bp
          dsDNA, with a G + C content of 48.51%. Its plaque diameters are
          approximately 2.5 mm to 0.5 mm on the agar plate. It inhibited
          Salmonella Enteritidis growth after 6 h. The growth curve showed that
          the latent and rise periods were approximately 40 min and 30 min,
          respectively. The burst size was estimated to be 56 PFU/cell. It can
          stabilize and maintain original activity between 4°C and 55°C for 1
          hr. These results indicate that phage-1252 is a promising candidate
          for controlling multiple S. enterica serovars in food production.

            Due to the rise in consumer demand for organic products, many
            conventional poultry farms are now growing poultry without
            antibiotics or synthetic chemicals. In addition to this,
            pasture/organic poultry farms have increased significantly in the
            U.S. and they are also antibiotic- and chemical-free. Both
            antibiotic-free conventional and pasture poultry farmers are facing
            the re-emergence of bacterial diseases, including fowl typhoid
            caused by Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Gallinarum
            biovars Gallinarum (S. Gallinarum) and pullorum disease caused by
            Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Gallinarum biovars
            Pullorum (S. Pullorum). These diseases cause higher mortality rate
            in the birds and lead to non-profitable poultry farming. In this
            study, we have investigated S. Gallinarum and S. Pullorum prevalence
            in the environment and farms' products. We also determined
            antimicrobial resistance patterns of S. Gallinarum and S. Pullorum.
            To achieve this goal, we aim to investigate potential sources and
            modes of entry for these bacterial pathogens. We have collected
            1,285 samples from farms and investigated the prevalence of S.
            Gallinarum and S. Pullorum within farm ecology/environment by using
            cultural and molecular techniques. We have also determined the
            antibiotic resistance pattern of the isolates following CLSI
            guidelines.
