                Farm animals in backyard farm (BF) and integrated crop-livestock

              </li>
              <li>

              Animals including livestock, pets, wild animals, birds, pest and
              rodents carry variety of human pathogens.

              These pathogens can spread to humans and the environment, and then
              from the environment to humans through food and water. Many
              pathogens can colonize animal gut and increase their number. The
              resulting infected animal feces poses an issue by increasing the
              spread of zoonotic pathogens.

              <h3>Recommendation for reducing farm animal-based risks</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Consider proximity (location/position) of animals to produce
                  fields, water sources and flood areas
                </li>
                <li>
                  Position crop areas appropriately, with barriers in place if
                  they are near animals or areas at risk of runoff by
                  considering nearby manure drops, manure lagoons or compost
                  piles, neighbors’ activity (farms and residences), etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Add barriers either:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Passive barriers: vegetative strips, fences, uphill, keep
                      compost covered
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Active barriers: plant less-risky crops; have workers
                      “wash out” between working with animals/produce; if
                      possible work with produce first, then animals
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Discourage wildlife/animals from entering production areas
                      by fencing, animal training, visual deterrents, sonic
                      canons, animal relocation, discouraging areas to roost or
                      nest, maintaining buildings in good conditions, keeping up
                      with pest control programs
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Anyone working with the animals should understand risks and be
                  trained to minimize risks, particularly:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Workers’ activity manual should outline procedures for
                      different activities that are found in the field
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Employ “no harvest buffer zones” around sites of
                      significant animal intrusion
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Radius around intrusion is determined by feces frequency,
                      trampling, splatter from rain or irrigation
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Cull produce, flag, bury, or remove feces from field
                      depending on harvest dates and repicking, clean hands and
                      tools
                    </li>
                    <li>Consider keeping a wildlife monitoring log</li>

            <hr />
            <p>
              Workers/visitors may carry human pathogens, such as Shigella,
              Hepatitis A, Norovirus, Cyclospora and others, as a carrier or
              asymptotically infected and/or mild sickness. These persons can
              spread pathogens to animal/plant as well as environment.
              Workers/visitors who are working with multiple farm components,
              can transfer pathogens (Salmonella and E. coli) from one component
              to others such as animals and plant/produce. Improper/unhygienic
              toilets or bathrooms enable workers to spread pathogens through
              the fecal-oral route, illness, and injury. Workers/visitors are
              often the last to touch produce before it reaches the consumer
              through clothing, footwear, or personal tools.

                      flooding by considering nearby manure drops, manure
                      lagoons or compost piles, neighbors’ activity (farms and

                    <li>

                    <li>
                      Put barriers either passive or active or both barriers
                      such as vegetative strips and fence; keep compost and
                      manure covered and plant less-risky crops uphill
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Have workers “wash out” between working with animals and
                      produce; work with produce first, then animals, if
                      possible

                    <li>
                      Separate finished compost from un-finished and know manure
                      treatment times and temperatures to make compost

                    <li>
                      As pathogens can survive in untreated manure, the
                      following time intervals must be maintained between manure
                      application and harvest of contact produce (lettuce,
                      carrots), 120 days, and non-contact produce (peppers,
                      corn), 90 days

            <ul>
              <li>
                Workers, farm livestock, and created waste materials including
                feces are potential sources/reservoirs of pathogens for either
                human, or animal or both and pathogens can spread from one farm
                component to another
              </li>
              <li>
                Vectors such as unexpected wild-animals, birds, rodents, and
                insects often also cross contaminate or introduce pathogens
              </li>
              <li>
                Considering the farm location and its animal/plant products,
                farmers or experts should develop a SOP and safety rules
              </li>
              <li>
                Training the workers and imposing the rules are the key to make
                safer products in ICLFs
              </li>
